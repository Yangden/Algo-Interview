# core
* Analyze the problem context and build the solution from ground.
* Apply the knowledge structure natually 

# idea to code implementation
* discover edge cases and avoid complex handling of edge cases 

# Leetcode 424
* flexible binary search space(leetcode OA)
* problem analysis : replacement - k - same characters - substring - longest 
* start from brute-force: **iterate through all substring -> if can be valid ? - simplify the problem - frequency map**
* what about next step: derive search problem. 
* design binary search combined with sliding-window to reduce computation.
